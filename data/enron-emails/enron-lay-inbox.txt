I do not know if this email will find your eyes or not....

  I just wanted to tell you, as a shareholder,
  since we are in a difficult time period,
  to PLEASE continue to keep your chin-up,
  and look at this "storm" as a time
  to be strong and use your courage to make the tough
  decisions to keep Enron afloat...and utilizing
  all your strength and prayers...you will
  be able to lead ENRON to safe harbors once again.

   Do not let the negative media effect you, please
   keep pushing forward, and you will be successful.

   This adversity will prepare you and strengthen
   you for the "perfect storm" we will run into
   throughout our existence...


   Thanks for listening...

   PS Back in during the Econmic Summit here in
      Houston, you met my daughter Sophia, and she
      wrote to you, and you took the time to write
      her back about 11 years old...
      well now she is 21 and a
      major in PR/Communications at BYU in Provo, UT,
      and on November 20th at 3:00 PM she has decided
      to marry to Jacob Little in Utah..

Mr. Lay,

I realize that during these particularly tough times that you probably will not have the time to read this. In addition, I presume that you have received a high volume of notes from your employees regarding the issues of the day. I do hope, however, that you will take a moment to consider my thoughts and to step back from today's headlines and consider all of the tremendous opportunities that you have given all of your employees over the past 16 years. Your vision and hard work has accomplished more than just a business; it has provided many thousands of families support and structure. 

I moved to Houston last year to continue my EBS career. I am over 52 years old with a career in telecommunications sales and sales management. I continue to be excited about EBS opportunities; even though the rumors have us eliminated. The industry will improve. Our time should be spent cultivating future business relationships and becoming a fixture at the prospective counter parties' decision table. Anyway, my decision to move to Houston rather than to accept an ATT Natl Accounts Mngr continues to be the correct move in my opinion. I must admit that if EBS goes down; I will be in a very difficult position (at my age) to find another position; but the point is this...I do not want to work for any other company other than Enron. I made a commitment to EBS two years ago; and I have not swayed. I want to continue to work as a midmarketer for Enron and I thank you for your commitment to me and your other employees at Enron.

Dad,
I just wanted to let you know that I love you and I am
here if you need ANYTHING!
I am in Boston until late Wednesday (I am visiting
Christina, Tad, and baby Jack). They all send their
love and support to you as well.
Jack is adorable!
We are all praying for you and all the people at
Enron.
I love you!

Ken - 
 
I appreciate the time today.  We look  forward to working with Enron, if the opportunity presents itself.  Atlas  can assist in structuring and raising substantial new equity - we already have  $150mm (subject to due diligence and terms and conditions) that has been "soft  circled".  Please feel free to call me at any time.

Ken - 
 
As a follow-up, we realize there has been  tremendous downward pressure on the stock recently and as a result selling new  equity at these levels could be very dilutive.  We can structure an equity  financing that is a premium to today's prices.  I would welcome the chance  to discuss this with you.

Dear Ken:

I of course still keep very close watch of how Enron is doing.  I am very
sad to see the problems you are facing today particularly since you were
really looking forward to slowing down a bit and spending more time with
your family.

I sincerely appreciate the kindness you showed me while at Enron and the
continued assistance and blessings you have sent my way since leaving Enron.
I will never forget what you have done for me.

Please, if there is any way that I can help you please let me know.  I am
willing to help you in any way you see fit.  When you have a moment of time
I would like to sit down with you and talk to you about some of the areas
that I beleive Enron lost its way and would like to see where you think I
could help you re-establish your vision for Enron.

Please do not consider this note simply kind words.  I sincerely want and
believe that I can help.


Best regards,

Sean

	Here is an update on the state of play in Washington regarding Dabhol as the Indian PM arrives this evening:

	As it became apparent last week that the discussions in Delhi about the MOU were not panning out, I met with OPIC President Watson and Exec VP Connelly to bring them up to speed on the status of discussions and map out the message to be given by the Administration to the PM on his visit this week.  While OPIC certainly does not have final say re the message on Dabhol they are clearly the driver within the USG and they have been very aggressive in that regard.  Out of our meeting Watson sent to State and the NSC a message with the following two points:
	1.  the Project sponsors, the $ lenders, and OPIC and EXIM are of one mind that the negotiating time frame on Dabhol is approaching its end.  If India does not act immediately it will be too late.
	2.  The President and this Administration needs to express its strong disappointment at the failure of the GOI to make an effort to engage on the Buyout, which needs to be negotiated within a particular $ range, subject to a simultaneous negotiation with the $ lenders.

	The OPIC memo was sent to State and the NSC and is now embodied in talking points for President Bush in his Friday meeting with the PM.  For the last week plus I have provided daily updates to OPIC, to Larson's office at State, to the South Asia regional group and to the NSC so they know of any new developments and where we are.  Yesterday afternoon I  met with OPIC on the lawsuit and how that might change the talking points.

	At this point, President Bush will raise Dabhol in his meeting with the PM Friday. The Indian Ambassador met with the NSC yesterday to discuss the agenda and was briefed on the MOU going in.
	It is being considered that Larry Lindsey will discuss Dabhol in greater detail, probably with Mishra.  There was some concern about prior relationship to Enron but I understand from State the lawyers have taken care of the concern.   
	Larson is in Doha but is current on the situation and can engage if necessary.  It is unfortunate he is out of town.
	Amb. Blackwill had dinner last night with Watson and Connelly of OPIC and claims he is on top of the issue.

	Last, but certainly not least, we have a meeting with the PMO Secretary Ghash (?) at 4:30 Thursday at the Indian Embassy.  I do not know if we have firmly decided yet who should attend.  If Jim is out as I understand he is perhaps Rob Walls and I can attend.  This meeting should give us an opportunity to respond in the Washington context to the proposal that I understand is in the offing in Singapore.  We will then be in a position to feed that information back into the USG so that the President's meeting with the PM reflects the current state of discussions.

Dear Ken:

These are very difficult times for all of us, but I know that you and those who work closest with you are under unbelievable pressure at this time.  It's difficult for all of us, but you and your staff need to know that you have a great deal of support within the company.  Since I started with EDC in 1996, I have often felt that this is the best job that I ever had.  In good times and not-so-good times, the work has been interesting, challenging and even fun!  Now that you are "back" many of us are more confident of the future -- even at this time when things appear to be so bleak.

Enron has treated me very well in the past, and although we face an uncertain future, I will continue to support the company and especially you.   Your gestures toward the employees are much appreciated.    I have always admired your kind and  respectful attitude toward all who work for Enron, never more than now.   You have been our best representative and our best supporter, not to mention what you have done for the city of Houston.  No matter what happens, I will always feel privileged to have been a part of this organization.

Most sincerely,

Nancy Muchmore

I tried to respond to your email below but it came back as undeliverable so I am resending it. I am praying hard so we will recover from our troubles. GOD BLESS ALL OF US.  I would like to thank you personally for all the hard work that you have been doing to save the company. We have faith in you and I know that you are doing your best to keep all your employees intact.

It really hurts whatever is happening to us (ENRON).  Maybe you and the rest of the management group have thought of this already but I still want to give my suggestion just in case it is not being considered as an option.  Can Enron possibly ask Washington DC (our government) to rescue us.  When I was in Pennsylvania I used to work for a railroad company and that company was in trouble for a while and the government gave help.  Now that Railroad is a private sector and making money and is contributing to the state as well as the local communities.

Dear Mr Lay,

I'm not sure if you remember, but I am the one who came up with the Lay it
on the Line slogan.  I am no longer with the company and am currently with
General Electric.
Regardless, I still have a stake in Enron.  Besides everything that is going
on that we can all read in the press, what concerns me is it seems that some
current leaders still don't care.  I was infuriated to learn that Enron (EES
in particular) still rented a corporate house on the golf course for the
tour championship in Houston and was seen grilling steaks, lobsters and
having a great time.   I wouldn't consider it entertaining clients if
Managing Directors such as Dan Leff were there with thier kids (rumor has
it).  That is a completely irresponsible waste of what little money is left
in the company and it shows the arrogance that Enron is perceived to have.
People should be fired for this.   I would hope that Christmas parties,
bonues etc will be scaled down this year and to at least make some sort of
effort to slash costs and get the company back on track.  I have faith in
you as a leader and I hope for a turnaround.  Thank you.Message-ID: <23058445.1075862885896.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Mr. Lay:

Thank you for taking the time to call Mr. Cotros at Sysco.  The ball is now moving in the right direction and we are doing all we can to close some meaningful business with them this quarter.

Yours with encouragement,

Subject:	Request For Assistance

Mr. Lay:

I would greatly appreciate your assistance in helping to strengthen a relationship EES has with Sysco Corporation.  

EES and Sysco began discussing a wide array of business opportunities with one another in the Fall of last year. On June 30th of this year, we entered into a 10 year electricity supply contract for all of Sysco's California facilities.  We are currently pursuing two important Q4 transactions with Sysco; an electricity supply contract for their Texas facilities and a demand side management contract for all of their facilities.

We had planned to close the Texas supply transaction today.  However, in a phone conversation I had this morning with Sysco's Director of Procurement, Terry Taylor I was informed that Sysco's CEO, Charles Cotros has instructed Mr. Taylor not to enter into any further transactions with us "until Enron's financial picture clears up".  Mr. Taylor believes that Mr. Cotros' concerns about Enron would be diminished if he received a call from a senior executive at Enron. 

Rosalee indicated that you and Mr. Cotros serve together on the Board of Directors for the Greater Houston Partnership. Would you please call Mr. Cotros and attempt to assuage his concerns about our financial condition.  Mr. Cotros is out of the office until Thursday, November 1st.  His direct phone number is (281) 584-1415.  His assistant is Andrea Walters and her phone number is (281) 584-1405.   Mr. Cotros' biography is as follows:   

Charles H. Cotros, age 64, has served as a director of SYSCO since 1985.  Mr. Cotros has served as Chairman of the Board since July 2000 and as Chief Executive Officer since January 2000.  He served as Chief Operating Officer from 1995 until January 2000 and as President from 1999 until July 2000.  He has been employed by SYSCO since 1974.  Mr. Cotros is Chairman of the Executive Committee and he is also a member of the Finance Committee.   Source: Proxy, 9/24/01

Thank you in advance for your consideration and anticipated assistance.  Otherwise, please let me know if you will not be able take the action requested and I will initiate an alternative plan.

Respectfully,

Craig Sutter

So when is Ken Lay going to tell us something with substance in these repor=

 on and snickered or made other negative remarks in response to today's ema=
il on behalf of Ken Lay. One person said she wished we would stop getting t=
hese emails because they are "empty." All we are getting are generalities a=
nd hollow comments about yesterdays news. Lets hear some positive statement=
s from Ken Lay making clear that the financial actions of Enron are clean. =
I would appreciate being told exactly what it is that the SEC is looking  f=
or. Many in the Portland office are asking just who are these Board members=
 and what is it that drives our Senior Management? We know their names, we =
don't understand their values. I want to see leadership. Where is Ken and t=
he Board? Mayor Guiliani got out in the public after the World Trade Center=
 disaster and reassured the public. He became a leader. He didn't sit in hi=
s office and have a ghost writer send empty emails to city employees.=20

I watched as Rite Aid went through something similar to what Enron is going=
 through. Enron would be well served to study the Rite Aid situation and le=
arn from their experience. Rite Aid stumbled along for 6 months while the B=
oard and CEO defended their actions and were not able to face reality until=
 the company stock fell from $50 to $3. You need to make dramatic changes i=
n the management structure or else management needs to step out and publicl=
y restore confidence. It does NO GOOD for the Board and Ken to stand behind=
 management and business groups only to turn around and put individuals "on=
 leave" or close those business groups you stood behind a day earlier.=20

I noticed how little confidence the top executives at Enron had in this com=
pany when they sold off hundreds of millions of dollars in stock between No=
vember and February. Many of us see that as the beginning of the moral bank=
ruptcy at the top of Enron. We put our retirement in your hands and you pil=
fered it. I had so much faith in Enron's management that I have taken my an=
nual bonus in stock options. To me that is a duty to demonstrate my commitm=
ent to Enron. Rumors are circulating in the Portland office that the Board =
is not likely to fund a bonus pool this year. Now that is inspiration! Is t=
hat true?=20

You MUST instill confidence in your employees TODAY. You claim that Enron e=
mployees are your most valuable assets. You had better treat them as such. =
Email such as this one DO NOT INSPIRE confidence. This is not Enron's proud=
est moment. I enjoy working for the company. I take pride in my work and do=
 my job honestly and open. The deals I bring in to this company are done in=
 the spirit of mutual benefits with our counter parties. I was disappointed=
 to get a copy of a PR piece in my home mail yesterday with interviews and =
profiles of "Three Men."  Reading their values and accomplishments led me t=
o believe these guys are motivated not by family and ethics but rather by m=
aterial possession. This is the intellect of failure. If your driven simply=
 to own a boat and your measure of success was recognized when you bought a=
 big house, there is a very high probability that you will breech the line =
of ethical (and perhaps legal) financial actions in order to have more.=20

Please send us a statement from Ken Lay and the Board telling us about the =
Cultural Values they are going to strive to instill in the company. I think=
 a huge statement would be made by having the Board of Directors and Ken La=

Ken Lay should come to Portland and give us reassurance that the earnings f=

Mr. Lay, I worked for ENRON from 5/97 until 5/01 and I just want to say
that I am so sorry that all of this is coming down on 'our Company'.   I
have worked for two companies that I feel are the strongest in their
sector, Bechtel and Enron.   Both Companies have back-bone and care about
their employees.  Please pull Enron through this economically trying time.
Things look tough but sometimes when the tough times hit - we have to hit
back.

Hi Ken,

You have always told us that we can email at any time with comments or questions.

Employees are really getting worried about what's happened with our stock price.  It's not looking too good.  I know you and upper management are working hard to sort this out.  Please let us know what is really going on.  Rumors are flying about layoffs, bankruptcy, and takeovers.  All of our lives are affected.  People are trying to hang in here, but the future is too uncertain.  We are wondering whether to stay or bail out.

We need more answers.

Another comment which is constantly being made is that, "It is not encouraging when we don't see upper management buying shares at these historically low prices".   Any comments?

Thanks,
Clara Carrington

Dear Ken:

I have encouraged all my academic executive friends to each purchase
1,000 shares of Enron.  I have just done so, and expect others to
follow suit.

Go Enron

This is a stand by.  It has been approved by Dynegy and the Baker Botts team.  Suggest we also draft a "what's next" release discussing private equity or other alternatives.  Steve and I will get something out soon for review.

Mr. Lay,
 
I have been with Enron for 33 years. I have found these years to have been interesting, to say the least, and have seen many changes during this time. I am proud to be part of an aggressive, growing company. And I have always had a high regard for the people driving the company.
 
I am now 60 years of age and I have been contemplating retirement and "pursuing other interests" as they say, with my remaining years. Imagine my despair at the state of affairs Enron has fallen to through what appears to be gross mismanagement. What was once envisioned as "those comfortable golden years" are now simply smoke. And after giving many of my years to this company it is devastating. It is hard for me to understand how this could happen without the knowledge of those of you at the head of the company, in my mind it was a "look the other way" situation without concern for anyone but yourselves and all that money for the fancy house, fancy cars, travel, etc. 
 
I will never understand everything that took place and why. I am certainly not alone in these feelings. But I would hope that Jeff Skilling, Andy Fastow and others involved in this travesty have as much trouble sleeping at night as I do.

Dear Mr. Lay,

My manager and I were discussing the possibility of doing a fund raiser for Enron.  We contributed an absorbant amount of money to charities this year and last, would it not be possible to raise money to help our company.  Do a little belt tightening.  We could do without the Christmas party, do without our bonuses and next year at this time, when we are back on top, it would be a sweeter glory knowing that the employees helped turn everything around.  I have spoken with my HR rep and several other employees about this possibility and we feel that we would be able to raise a substantial amount of money.  Please let me know what your view on this would be and we will work on what steps we need to take to make it happen.

Thank you for your time.

Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.Message-ID: <3544.1075862886575.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Ken,

I feel terrible in writing this email to inform you that I am leaving Enron.
The timing of my departure is purely coincidental to the timing of the recent
events.

It has been a special and rewarding privilege to work at Enron over the past
three and a half years.  The integrity and high purpose you stand for is a
personal inspiration to me.  Seeing your leadership first-hand has been a
real treat.

Receiving the Chairman's Award last year was an incredible honor.  It is
difficult for me to feel truly deserving of it because of the sheer numbers
of amazingly dedicated, yet unrecognized heroes I have met at Enron.  I have
the greatest admiration of them and draw my inspiration from them.

One regret in leaving is that there will be those at Enron who will use my
departure as more negative fodder to taint the company image.  I wouldn't
ever wish that on you, especially in light of the recent challenges you are
experiencing.  So I apologize if that does come to pass.

One factor in my departure has been my disappointment with personnel abuses
I've observed with EES' origination management.  There is a general feeling 
of despair because the management chain looks the other way and the concept 
of an "open door" is political suicide.  H.R. is as much at fault in my 
opinion because they side with management as opposed to taking an objective 
view and judgement of the abuses.  My words and credibility may not carry 
any weight as I too have been victimized by the character assassination 
that is all too common at EES.

Though my emotions run high when I think about the injustices to good employees 
(and lost potential benefit to Enron), I leave with no bad feelings toward the company
and am proud to have been a part of Enron.

The shift in EES' business model had resulted in my taking on a new role this
past spring.  Being based outside of Houston (in the Chicago area), my career
opportunities are limited.  And as much as I tried, I was feeling stale and
unfulfilled in this new role and decided that it would be better for me to
move on.

Ken, I believe in you and wish you success and redemption through this difficult 
time.  I wish that I could have done more.  

If I can ever help, I hope that you won't hesitate to ask.  Thank you again.

Respectfully,

mark

Mr. Lay, 
I am a former employee of Enron and have been through many trials in the past few years. God has been faithful and seen me through them all. Dear sir, I can tell you that I can count it all joy. I just want to encourage you. These look like very dark times right now. Call upon the name of the Lord. Throw yourself on the mercy and grace of the Lord and remember all that he has done. He is a BIG, GOOD God that LOVES you! His arm hasn't been shortened that He cannot help you. 
You will be glad to know that the true testimony of you as a man is of a good report. You will glorify God in this. I am listening to a song right this minute that I so wish you could hear. It would bring you such comfort. It is based on the verse that talks about "all of my help cometh from the Lord". How true that is for you. 
Lord Jesus, you are a good God that sees all things. Mr. Lay is a man of God. That means he is your child. You tell us that you are an ever present help in time of trouble. These troubles are over his head but under your feet. Lord Jesus, show yourself strong on his behalf. Glorify yourself and Mr. Lay will give you the glory. He knows, Lord. Help him in this time when the waters are flowing over his head. Hear him from where you are. We are all but dust. Who are we that you are mindful of us but you tell us in your Word that You have good thoughts and plans for us and they are for good and NOT EVIL that we may have an expected end. (Jer 29:11-For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.) Who can stand except you give us grace? Lord, you are so good. Remind Mr. Lay of who you really are. In the mighty name of Jesus!

Mr. Lay, get some scripture to hang onto-write it down on a card and carry it with you. When things come against you (the enemy), you will need to remember who you are in Jesus! The greatest battle on earth was fought with the Word of God (Satan against Jesus in the wilderness)!
Isaiah 54:17-No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.
Oh Mr. Lay, one more thing. I am telling you that I haven't a clue as to what has or has not been done. I just want to show you something from the Word of God how God is. If you will read Isaiah's calling in Isaiah 6 and read Moses' calling in Exodus 3, you will see that God DOES NOT mention their sin to them. Isaiah was just overcome with the glory of God and confessed all by himself and Moses (remember he had killed an Egyptian) was just trying to convince God that He had to be wrong. The ONLY reason I mention it is because sometimes we delay in going to God because we think we have done something wrong. God tells us that He hasn't dealt with us according to our sins. KNOW that NO MATTER WHAT, Jesus is ready to fight on your behalf! It is ALWAYS about God's SPIRIT and not our strength. 
When I started this email, you were just a stranger. You are now my beloved brother in Christ. Isn't it amazing how God works. He has knit my heart to yours. I will be on my knees for you. Phillipians tells us to pray for E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G! What does everything mean? EVERYTHING! God's gonna do some amazing stuff so get ready!!!! His ways aren't our ways and remember too-He is able to do EXCEEDINGLY ABOVE what we can ask or think!
Lynda Phinney 
The Joy of the Lord is my strength...

Mr. Lay:

I am Marilynne Haws one of your stockholders.  I am 70 years old and was
quite proud of my Enron stock..  Part of the stock I inherited and part I
bought.  I do not have a lot of money, so loosing money is very terrifying
for me.  The dishonesty  of Enron has been a disapointment to me.  I put the
blame entirely on you as you should have been watching the store instead of
politicking.  I still like to believe that in your case it was ego, not
dishonesty that caused you to allow this mess to happen.
I am ashamed of you as l leader of industry, as a Republican and I just hope
that you are not a Methodist.

Hello Ken

As we have not had a recent "daily update" from you - I write inquiring about the status of OUR company.

We heard about the acquisition discussions with Dynegy through the press (NOT from Enron's management!).  Clearly, this does not engender confidence in the management's communication philosophy.

We also heard that there is a meeting planned with Enron's banks on Friday - again through the press!  Communication failed again.

Further reductions in confidence came as Enron restated it's financial statements for the period 1997 through 2000.  Again this news was provided by the press!

Couple of questions for you - who were the commercial folks putting together the LJM, Chewco etc. deals?  Who were senior managers approving these deals?  Perhaps Enron should part company with some of those folks too.  

Where was the board and where were you when these deals were being done?  There appears to have been no corporate governance at the relevant periods!

On a personal level, I have invested many years in this company.  I currently have a holding of approx. 4,500 shares which I purchased because I believed in the company.  I also have numerous share options.  

Unfortunately, this episode has obliterated my confidence in management and in particular in you and Jeff Skilling.  I suspect you guys are ok - as you had the foresight (knowledge?) to cash out your holding during the latter part of last year and most of this year.

Please be aware that the fate of thousands of people rests in your hands.

I would be interested to hear your views.

Ken, I am a loyal Enron Employee for over 17 years and my opinion (however insignificant) is that we stand and fight and not take any buy out offer from anyone.

I know that I speak for the rest of my team when I say lets stand and fight and not sell out to the first bidder who will not give us what we are really worth.  We are the best and continue to be the best in the energy world, that is my attitude every day that I proudly come to work.  

Please reconsider and take our lumps like Columbia Gas System, like Continental Airlines and get back into solvency the best way we know how to.  The past is past, lets pick up ourselves by our boot straps and get back into the fight and win this one.

You know that you can count on me and the rest of my team in ETS to stand by this decision to stand and fight.

Ever Loyal and willing to serve.

Rudy Elizondo (ETS).

Dear Mr. Lay,
I don't know much about the vast world of business and i'm not extremely knowledgeable about the happenings within the corporation, but I do know about perseverance.  I understand that you made Enron the powerhouse that it is through perseverance, and no matter how difficult things are right now, Enron will return to the top.  I respect you a great deal as a businessman, and I know that you will find a way to bring the company out of these times.

I'm just a "Pea-On", but it's a shame to let Dynegy have the company for $8 billion dollars.  Enron is often known and admired for their creative and bright minds.  Why can't the people buy the company, we are going less than a football team.  I know certainly we are a lot smarter.  It's awful that we're getting calls from the enemy telling us to "Get out of their new building".  You help build this company, you have idea's don't just throw it away on one month of bad press.  If you give up, they will say it's always better the old way.   WE ARE ENRON, WE HAVE CLASS, AND WE DONT LAY DOWN AND DIE.  WE HAVE A SOLUTION.!!!!

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997

Dear Mr. Lay:
Sub: Sale of Power Plant in India

I met you in your office with rev. James Dixon regarding earthquake in India.
I came to Washington to see Honorable Prime Minister of India today.

After reading in Nov. 12th issue of Business Week, I talked with Ambassador of
India regarding sale of power plant built by Enron India. He said that
discussions are going on in Singapore. Hon. Prime Minister will be in
Washington Friday also.

If you would like to pursue selling the power plant in India to Tatas or any
other party soon, please email or have your office call me at Washington
contact phone number 301 897-3488 Friday. I will be back in Houston Sunday
afternoon.

I have also met Dr. Boyce who lives in your complex on 28th floor, 2121 Kirby.
We both are working on Fundraising for fallen Fire Fighter Jack Janhke,
Woodway station number 2.

Sincerely,
Sam Kannappan P.E.

Mr. Lay,
Just wanted to let you know that we're keeping the faith, and wish you all the best in your endeavor to pull Enron out of this current predicament. And that we're working as hard as ever to make sure that Enron remains the pioneering innovative company that it is. Sincerely hope everything ends favorably. 

Warm Regards, good luck and God bless.

A request for 2002 contribution was mailed from the NCPA in error this week.
We realize Enron is going through a tough time, and wanted to apoligize for
sending a request for money at this time.

John and I wish you our best, and know your strength will overcome this
challenge.

We appreciate your efforts on our behalf, and look forward to seeing you in
the future.

Take a look and let me know what I need to do...We are ready to FedEx
letters from Sen. Frist re: the event..Perhaps we should have Mr. Lay send a
letter early in the week and then do a follow up letter from Sen. Frist..We
can follow up with some phone calls from Haley Barbour and Sen. Frist to key
people...Do you think Mr. Lay will have some time to work the phones?  I
know this is been a rough spot for ya'll but I appreciate all your help...As
a small Enron shareholder, I appreciate your hard work...

How can you sell Enron for $9.50 per share?  We've already lost almost everything we have in our 401k and the only hope to recover anything is if Enron can battle back.  Is the company in such poor shape that it can't survive on its own?  If so, how did that happen?Message-ID: <15854182.1075862886975.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Attached are the latest communication materials.  We DO NOT have a deal yet, but I am sending these so that you have time to review before holding floor/staff meetings in the event we have an announcement later today.  Please do not forward these materials, as they are not yet final.  If there are any changes in these materials when the deal becomes final, I will resend them.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you.

Dear Ken,

I have not called because I know that you have much to attend to and little
time to spare, but I wanted you to know that I and all of your friends have
been thinking of you and are concerned for you.  You have my complete
support.  If I can be of assistance please call.

Ernie
