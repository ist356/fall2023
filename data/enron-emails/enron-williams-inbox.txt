In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, *.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.

We have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful e-mail viruses. We believe that these protections will result in less down time for your e-mail, in the event that Enron gets hit with a virus or malicious code.Message-ID: <30632121.1075845377641.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Jason,  it's me, Jay Elms.  You know, Amanda's husband.

What's going on?  I understand you and Ferg are only playing about 72 holes
of golf per week.  Down from the normal 96.  I'm up to about 18 holes every
6 months.  I'll dominate both of you when we play again.  Ya'll need to come
visit us in Austin.

Hey, I've got a buddy I worked with that also got laid off.. he was in
corporate communications for us.  Can you get the name of someone in Enron's
Corp. communications dept.?  He is interested in Enron and I told him you
were the president of the company and could basically hand him a job if he
wanted it..

If you can get a name, that would be fine.. if not, no problem.

Thanks,
Gay

A man with a black eye, boards a plane bound for Pittsburgh and sits
down.
He immediately notices that the man next to him also has a black eye
and
says, "Hey this is a coincidence, we both have black eyes; mind if I
ask
how you got yours?"

The other guy replies, "Well, it was a tongue twister accident.  I was
at
the ticket counter and this gorgeous blonde with the most beautiful
large
breasts was there. So, instead of saying, 'I'd like two tickets to
Pittsburgh,' I accidentally said, 'I'd like two pickets to
Tittsburgh.'...and she socked me a good one."

The first guy replied, "Wow! This is unbelievable. Mine was a tongue

To all,

I'm coming to TX!  I wanted to get in touch with all my Texas friends (or
those near there) so if you happen to be in the area, I'd love to see you or
hear from you.

The boys and I are going to be in Houston from June 5th-25th so we can visit
family and enjoy the sunshine!  Unfortunately, Wayne just started his new
job here in Vilseck and won't be able to join us this time.

So, you can still reach Wayne in Germany.  But, I can be reached in Texas at
281-463-7843 or through this email which I will check periodically.

Hope to see you soon!

--Tara

It's that time again.  If you are up for playing 42 this Thursday (6/7),
please let me know.  We'll kick things off around 8:00 PM.  So far, I have
verbal commitments from Jason, Von, and Mike.  I was hoping to get two
tables going and try to play a round robin tourney.  So, Todd (it's been a
couple of weeks), Scott (you said that you wanted to play), Hatch (you had
fun last time, right?), and Ferg (you don't want to miss the fun, do you?)
reply to this e-mail and let me know you can make it.

Jason,
	Irene Isais of our Transportation Services department notified me
that Enron North America was cut 1 MMBtu per day from March 13th through
March 15th.  The 1 dekatherm cut occurred on Trunkline.

Peoples will reduce the baseload FOM priced quantity on the 13th and 15th by
1 MMBtu.

It will cut the DIQ amount of 21,973 by 1 dekatherm on gas day March 14th.

The FOM price was greater than Gas Daily on the 13th and 15th while Gas
Daily was the higher price on the 14th.

Hey, Dave, 

Users of the People's Energy web site on the Chicago side have raised an issue that 
it takes several times to click the "submit" button on the Nomination page (http://peoplesenergy.enron.com/nominationsNew.asp) 
to actually insert the data to the database, and then these data become viewable on the other page. 
Please look into this when you get back. The contact on Chicago side is Jerry at 312 762 1654. (he will be out next week, and come
back on the 18th.) Jason should be able to answer related questions too. 

Thanks.

Yan

Jason,
	138 MMBtu was cut after the final GISB cycle on ANR Contract 104684.
The cut was the result of Northern Border confirming the incorrect number
during the timely, evening and intraday 1 cycles.

The supply @ Will County for Peoples went from 40,000 to 39,862.  Peoples
Gas reduced its SIQ purchase from Enron North America.  The purchase went
from 125,000 to 124,862.

pass on to ferg.

I am going at lunch to buy tickets.  I'm going to look
at the $11 - $15 range.  Let me know how many you need
before tomorrow at 10am.

If any of you can't decide by then, just buy tickets
on your own and we can all meet at cabo for a beer
before the game.

I assume no word from any of you is a 'no'.

Hi Everyone,

In GCP, we show Novartis Crop Protection, Inc. as the former name, on the Available Counterparty List.   If you click on Novartis, from that list,  it takes you to the new name, Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc., which is the correct name, as Jay indicates.  Did I miss something?

Bernice & Samuel -

In our system, we are showing Novartis Crop Protection, Inc. as the new name of Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc.  This is backwards.  Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc. is the new name.

Please change in Global Counterparty.

Jason,
	Cora and Irene told me the Enron delivery to Peoples Gas for gas day
May 1st will be cut by 21 MMBtu.  Peoples will reduce the SIQ purchase of
125,000 by 21 leaving an SIQ amount of 124,979.

Apparently, the reduction is due to confirmation problems on Northern
Border.

Jason,
	Peoples Gas ANR Contract 104684 was cut on gas days May 1st and 2nd
by 4 and 19 dekatherms respectively.  The 40,000 baseload volume became
39,996 for the 1st and 39,981 for the 2nd.

	The cuts were due to nomination mismatches between Northern Border
and ANR.  For example, the Enron nomination on Northern Border for contract
R0259F was 19,424 while the quantity communicated to PGL Gas Supply for that
contract was 19,405.  An attempt to restore the gas was made during the
intraday cycles but not all of the supply was confirmed.

Peoples will reduce its SIQ purchase on the 1st and 2nd by 4 and 19
dekatherms respectively.

Hope he can help you out.

Bryan,

	We have a Web based application that access the oracle tns peoplesdev.  I receive the error ORACLE not available.
I'm trying to find out who maintains the db where this, and it's production version lives to see if we can resolve the issue.  Any
help you can provide is greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

David,

	Bryan referred me to you.  We are supporting the People's Energy website which interfaces with an Oracle db.  
It has been functioning properly until recently.  I currently do not have insight to see what the connection string is in production,
but when trying to connect to the development database "peoplesdev", using U=peoples_user P=peoples_user, I am receiving the
error "ORACLE not available".

Do you know if this database is out, or if the login parameters have changed?

Thanks,

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don on their new roles.

 Organization Announcement (Correction) 

I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience my mistake caused.  I had indicated that Kenneth Lovejoy would be supporting EES, but this is not correct.  Ken will be supporting  OEC.  Corrected announcement is provided below. 

 It is my pleasure to announce that Kenneth Lovejoy has joined Enron Corp. EH&S Asset Operations.  He will be reporting directly to Donnie Willmann and  will support Central America, Caribbean and OEC.  Ken has over 25 year experience in environmental, health and safety for the oil and gas industry.   He has been working for Enron since 1996 and has extensive international experience.    We are excited to have Ken in our team so, please welcome Ken in his new role.
